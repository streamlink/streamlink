Streamlink is a CLI utility that pipes flash videos from online streaming services to a variety of video players such as VLC, or alternatively, a browser.

The main purpose of streamlink is to convert CPU-heavy flash plugins to a less CPU-intensive format.

Streamlink is a fork of the [livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) project.

Please note that by using this application you're bypassing ads run by
sites such as Twitch.tv. Please consider donating or paying for subscription
services when they are available for the content you consume and enjoy.
