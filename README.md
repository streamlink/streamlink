# üì¶ Installation

Please take a look at the documentation for different ways of installing Streamlink:

- [Windows][streamlink-installation-windows]
- [macOS][streamlink-installation-macos]
- [Linux and BSD][streamlink-installation-linux-and-bsd]
- [PyPI package and source code][streamlink-installation-pypi-source]


# üëç Features

Streamlink is built on top of a plugin system which allows support for new services to be added easily.

Most of the popular streaming services are supported, such as:

- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
- [Livestream](https://livestream.com)
- [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com)

... and many more. A list of all plugins currently included can be found on the [plugins page][streamlink-plugins].


# üí° Quickstart

After installing, simply run:

```sh
streamlink "STREAMURL" best
```

The default behavior of Streamlink is to play back streams in the [VLC player][player-vlc], but a lot of other options and output methods are available, such as writing the stream to the filesystem, reading stream metadata, etc.

For more in-depth usage, please refer to the [CLI documentation][streamlink-documentation-cli].

An [API guide][streamlink-documentation-apiguide] and [API reference][streamlink-documentation-apiref] is available for Python implementors of Streamlink.
