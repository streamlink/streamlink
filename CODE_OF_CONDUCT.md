Minimalist Code of Conduct
====

We believe that an elaborate code of conduct invites a lot of fighting over intricate details, much like law, and we do not have the resources to build up the equivalent of a legal system. Therefore we prefer keeping our rules as short as possible and filling the gaps with the mortar of human interaction: empathy.

All we ask of members and contributors of this project is this:

- Please treat each other with respect and understanding.
- Please respect our wish to not serve as a stage for disputes about fairness or personal differences.

If you can agree to these conditions, your contributions are welcome. If you can not, please don't spoil it for the rest of us.
