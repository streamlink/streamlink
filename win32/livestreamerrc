# By default livestreamer will attempt to locate VLC on your system
# and use that, but you can also specify the location of a player
# yourself.

# Important: You must use a quoted path if there are spaces in the path. This
# is because the player command is parsed like a shell command to allow
# parameters to be passed to the player.

# Here is a few examples of players:

# VLC
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
# Using --file-caching is recommended, but is only supported in VLC 2.0+
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000

# MPC-HC, must be at least version 1.7 to be used
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\MPC-HC\mpc-hc.exe"

# MPlayer2
#player=C:\mplayer2\mplayer2.exe -cache 4096


# Use this if you want to transport the stream to the player via a named pipe.
#player-fifo

# Use this if you want to transport the stream to the player via HTTP.
#player-http

# Use this if you want Livestreamer to only pass a URL to your player and
# let it handle the transport of the stream itself.
#player-passthrough=http,hls,rtmp

# By default Livestreamer will close the player when stream is over.
# Use this option to let the player stay or close itself instead.
#player-no-close

# Use this option if you want Livestreamer to keep trying to access
# the stream even if it goes offline or disconnects. Your player must
# support HTTP and it's playlist should be set to repeat mode.
#player-continuous-http

# Show console output from the video player
#verbose-player

# RTMP streams are downloaded using rtmpdump. Full path to the rtmpdump exe
# should be specified here.
rtmpdump=@INSTDIR@\rtmpdump\rtmpdump.exe

# Log level, default is info
#loglevel=debug

# Cookies to authenticate the user to Twitch/JustinTV. Needed for streams
# that require authentication. Replace with actual values from your browser session.
#jtv-cookie=_twitch_session_id=xxxxxx; persistent=xxxxx;

# Cookies to authenticate the user to allow access to GOMTV.net streams.
# Replace with actual values from your browser session.
#gomtv-cookie=SES_MEMBERNO=xxx; SES_STATE=xxx; SES_MEMBERNICK=xxx; SES_USERNICK=xxx;
