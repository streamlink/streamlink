# Format is option=value. Lines starting with a # is considered comments

# By default streamlink will attempt to locate VLC on your system
# and use that, but you can also specify the location of a player
# yourself.

# Important: You must use a quoted path if there are spaces in the path. This
# is because the player command is parsed like a shell command to allow
# parameters to be passed to the player.

# Here is a few examples of players:

# VLC
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"
# Using --file-caching is recommended, but is only supported in VLC 2.0+
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000
#player="C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" --file-caching=5000

# MPC-HC, must be at least version 1.7 to be used
#player="C:\Program Files (x86)\MPC-HC\mpc-hc.exe"

# MPlayer2
#player=C:\mplayer2\mplayer2.exe -cache 4096


# Use this if you want to transport the stream to the player via a named pipe.
#player-fifo

# Use this if you want to transport the stream to the player via HTTP.
#player-http

# Use this if you want streamlink to only pass a URL to your player and
# let it handle the transport of the stream itself.
#player-passthrough=http,hls,rtmp

# By default streamlink will close the player when stream is over.
# Use this option to let the player stay or close itself instead.
#player-no-close

# Use this option if you want streamlink to keep trying to access
# the stream even if it goes offline or disconnects. Your player must
# support HTTP and its playlist should be set to repeat mode.
#player-continuous-http

# Show console output from the video player
#verbose-player

# RTMP streams are downloaded using rtmpdump. Full path or relative path
# to the rtmpdump exe should be specified here.
#rtmpdump=C:\Program Files (x86)\Streamlink\rtmpdump\rtmpdump.exe
rtmpdump=rtmpdump.exe

# FFMPEG is used to mux separate video and audio streams in to a single
# stream so that they can be played. The full or relative path to ffmpeg
# or avconv should be specified here.
#ffmpeg-ffmpeg=C:\Program Files (x86)\Streamlink\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe
ffmpeg-ffmpeg=ffmpeg.exe

# Log level, default is info
#loglevel=debug

# Number of threads to use when streaming HLS streams
#hls-segment-threads=1

# Number of threads to use when streaming HDS streams
#hds-segment-threads=1
