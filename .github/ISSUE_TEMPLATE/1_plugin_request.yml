        ## Thanks for requesting a plugin!

        [READ THE PLUGIN REQUEST REQUIREMENTS IN THE CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES BEFORE POSTING!](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#plugin-requests)

        **DON'T IGNORE this template and fill in all the required details.**
        **Issues that don't adhere to our request will be closed and ignored.**
        This is because analyzing bugs, issues or requests without proper details and log output is harder than necessary.
        Low quality and low effort issues are noise and steal the time of the maintainers and contributors.
