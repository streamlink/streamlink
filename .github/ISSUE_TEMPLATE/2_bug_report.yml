        ## What is a bug report?

        Bugs are the result of broken functionality within Streamlink's main code base.
        This can be a bug in the command-line interface, the various streaming protocol implementations, or the core Streamlink APIs, etc.

        **Use the [plugin issue template](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/new/choose) if your report is about a broken plugin.**
        [See the list of the available plugins here.](https://streamlink.github.io/plugins.html)

        ## DON'T IGNORE this template

        **Please fill in all the required details and don't skip any parts.**
        **Issues that don't adhere to our request will be closed and ignored immediately.**

        This is because analyzing bugs, issues or requests without proper details and log output is harder than necessary.
        Low quality and low effort issues are noise and steal the time of the maintainers and contributors.

        Post the **exact output** of [`streamlink --no-config --version`](https://streamlink.github.io/cli.html#cmdoption-version).
        Issues without a valid version string will be closed and ignored immediately.

        Before you continue, check the [list of recent releases](https://streamlink.github.io/changelog.html) or run `streamlink --no-config --version-check`.

        The mandatory debug log down below still needs to include the explicit version string.

        Explain the bug as thoroughly as you can.
        Please also provide the exact steps for reproducing the issue.

        Any kind of packaging issue except for Streamlink's own sdist/bdist packages on PyPI does not belong here and should be reported on the respecting issue tracker or to the respecting third-party packager.

        **DEBUG LOG OUTPUT IS REQUIRED for bug reports!**

        INCLUDE THE ENTIRE COMMAND LINE and make sure to **remove sensitive data like usernames, passwords, cookies, etc!**
        Issues that don't include a **full debug log** will be closed and ignored immediately.

        Use the [`--loglevel=debug`](https://streamlink.github.io/latest/cli.html#cmdoption-loglevel) parameter and avoid using parameters which suppress log output.
        Debug log includes important details about the used Python environment. **Don't remove it.**

        If the log output is too long and repetitive parts can't be truncated, or if you have multiple log outputs to share, then please post a link to a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the log output instead.

        **DO NOT post screenshots of the log output and instead copy the text from your terminal application.**
