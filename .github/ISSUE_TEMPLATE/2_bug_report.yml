        ## Thanks for reporting a bug!

        Bugs are the result of broken functionality within Streamlink's main code base.

        **Use the [plugin issue template](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/new/choose) if your report is about a broken plugin.**

        ----

        **DON'T IGNORE this template and fill in all the required details.**
        **Issues that don't adhere to our request will be closed and ignored.**
        This is because analyzing bugs, issues or requests without proper details and log output is harder than necessary.
        Low quality and low effort issues are noise and steal the time of the maintainers and contributors.

        **DEBUG LOG OUTPUT IS REQUIRED for bug reports!**
        INCLUDE THE ENTIRE COMMAND LINE and make sure to **remove usernames and passwords**

        Use the [`--loglevel=debug`](https://streamlink.github.io/latest/cli.html#cmdoption-loglevel) parameter and avoid using parameters which suppress log output.
        Debug log includes important details about your platform and the version you're using. Don't remove it.

        If the log output is too long and repetitive parts can't be truncated, or if you have multiple log outputs to share, please post a link to a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the log output instead.

        **DO NOT post screenshots of the log output and instead copy the text from your terminal application.**
