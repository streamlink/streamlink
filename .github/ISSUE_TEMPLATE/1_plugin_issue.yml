        > **What is a plugin issue?**
        > Plugin issues describe broken functionality within a plugin's code base, e.g. the streaming site has made breaking changes, streams don't get resolved correctly, or authentication has stopped working, etc.
        >
        > Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/issues/new/choose) if your report is about an otherwise generic bug.
        > [See the list of the available plugins here.](https://streamlink.github.io/plugins.html)

        > [!CAUTION]
        > **DO NOT IGNORE this template**
        > Please fill in all the required details and don't skip any parts.
        > Issues that don't adhere to our request will be closed and ignored immediately.
        >
        > This is because analyzing bugs, issues or requests without proper details and log output is harder than necessary.
        > Low quality and low effort issues are noise and steal the time of the maintainers and contributors.

        Post the **exact output** of [`streamlink --no-config --version`](https://streamlink.github.io/cli.html#cmdoption-version).
        Issues without a valid version string will be closed and ignored immediately.

        Before you continue, check the [list of recent releases](https://streamlink.github.io/changelog.html) or run `streamlink --no-config --version-check`.

        The mandatory debug/trace log down below still needs to include the explicit version string.

        Explain the plugin issue as thoroughly as you can.
        Please also provide the exact steps for reproducing the issue, e.g. a list of input URLs.
        To exclude issues on the streaming website/service itself, all input URLs must be working fine in your web browser.

        Remember that it is impossible for the developers and maintainers of this project to be aware of specific details of every site/plugin.

      label: Debug/trace log
      description: |
        **DEBUG/TRACE LOG OUTPUT IS REQUIRED for plugin issues!**

        INCLUDE THE ENTIRE COMMAND LINE and make sure to **remove all sensitive data from the entire log output, like usernames, passwords, cookies, etc!**
        Issues that don't include a **full debug/trace log** will be closed and ignored immediately.

        Use the [`--loglevel=debug` / `--loglevel=trace`](https://streamlink.github.io/latest/cli.html#cmdoption-loglevel) parameter and avoid using parameters which suppress log output.
        Debug/trace log includes important details about the used Python environment. **Don't remove it.**

        If the log output is too long and repetitive parts can't be truncated, or if you have multiple log outputs to share, then please post a link to a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the log output instead.

        **DO NOT post screenshots of the log output and instead copy the text from your terminal application.**
