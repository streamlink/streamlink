        ## What is a plugin request?

        The purpose of Streamlink's plugins is to translate input URLs from certain websites to specific stream URLs with optionally required parameters, access tokens, etc.
        [READ THE PLUGIN REQUEST REQUIREMENTS IN THE CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES BEFORE REQUESTING A PLUGIN!](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#plugin-requests)

        [See the list of already available plugins here.](https://streamlink.github.io/plugins.html)

        ## DON'T IGNORE this template

        **Please fill in all the required details and don't skip any parts.**
        **Issues that don't adhere to our request will be closed and ignored immediately.**

        This is because analyzing bugs, issues or requests without proper details and log output is harder than necessary.
        Low quality and low effort issues are noise and steal the time of the maintainers and contributors.
