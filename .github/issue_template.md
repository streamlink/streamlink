<!--
DEBUG LOG OUTPUT IS OPTIONAL for generic issues!
INCLUDE THE ENTIRE COMMAND LINE and make sure to **remove usernames and passwords**

Despite being optional for generic issues, depending on the issue, log output can be useful for the developers to understand the problem. It also includes information about your platform. If you don't intend to include log output, please at least provide these platform details. Thanks!

Use the `--loglevel debug` parameter and avoid using parameters which suppress log output.

You can copy the output to https://gist.github.com/ or paste it below.

Don't post screenshots of the log output and instead copy the text from your terminal application.

All log output should go between two blocks of triple backticks (grave accents) for proper formatting.
