Streamlink
==========

Overview
--------

Streamlink is a :ref:`command-line utility <cli:Command-Line Interface>` which pipes video streams
from various services into a video player, such as `VLC`_.
The main purpose of Streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites,
while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.
There is also an :ref:`API <api_guide:API Guide>` available for developers who want access
to the stream data.

This project was forked from Livestreamer, which is no longer maintained.

Features
--------

Streamlink is built on top of a plugin system which allows support for new services to be added easily.
Most of the popular streaming services are supported, such as
`Twitch <https://www.twitch.tv/>`_, `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/>`_, and many more.

A list of all plugins currently included can be found on the :ref:`plugins <plugins:Plugins>` page.

Quickstart
----------

The default behavior of Streamlink is to play back streams in the `VLC <https://www.videolan.org/>`_ player.
