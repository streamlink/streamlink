    If you're a developer and want to add your project/application to this list, please

    1. adhere to the same structure and format of the entries of the applications.rst file and this one
    2. add your new entry to the bottom of the list
    3. at least provide the required fields (in the same order)
       - "Description" (a brief text describing your application)
       - "Type" (eg. Graphical User Interface, CLI wrapper, etc.)
       - "OS" (please use the available substitutions)
       - "Author" (if possible, include a link to the creator's Github/Gitlab profile, etc. or a contact email address)
       - "Website"
    4. use an image
       - in the jpeg or png format
       - with a static and reliable !!!https!!! URL (use Github or an image hoster like Imgur, etc.)
       - with a reasonable size and aspect ratio
       - with a decent compression quality
       - that is not too large (at most 1 MiB allowed, the smaller the better)
       - that is neutral and only shows your application
    5. optionally add more fields like a URL to the source code repository, a larger info or features text, etc.

    Please be aware that the Streamlink team may edit and remove your entry at any time.

    Thank you! :)
