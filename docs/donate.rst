Donating
--------

Thank you for considering a donation to the Streamlink team!

Streamlink is an organization composed of a geographically diverse group of
individuals. Donations/tips can be sent in a variety of ways. If you would like
to donate directly to a specific user, please review their details in the
team section below.

If you would prefer to donate to the team as a whole, please use our
`Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/streamlink>`_.

Note that donations are not tax deductible, as Streamlink does not operate as
a charitable organization. Your donation to the team or a team member may be
used in any way and does not come with expectations of work to be provided or
as payment for future work.
