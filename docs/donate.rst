**Shutdown of Streamlink's Open Collective account**

In 2017, Streamlink started using Open Collective as a platform in order to receive tips from financial contributors for
supporting the team and for covering expenses. However, due to the composition of the team and the way work on this free
open source software project is done by individual team members on a variable and voluntary basis, it was determined that
the Open Collective account was not working as planned, and it was eventually shut down in 2023.
