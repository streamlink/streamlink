    # Streamlink publishes three wheels on PyPI: the generic "any" wheel, the "win32" wheel and the "win-amd64" wheel:
    # The Windows-wheels are special, because they include a "gui_scripts" entry point, which is used by the `pip` frontend
    # to generate the "streamlinkw" launcher, which doesn't open a terminal window when launching it from a GUI application.
    #
    # In order to build these special Windows-wheels, the `--plat-name=...` CLI argument needs to get passed
    # to the `bdist_wheel` setuptools command (provided by the `wheel` package). With the introduction of PEP517 however,
    # setuptools's CLI is not used directly anymore, and instead, we have to build the wheels using the `build` package
    # and the `--wheel --config-setting=--build-option=...` args, which are then forwarded to setuptools via the PEP517 hooks.
    #
    # Since `build==1.0.0` though, the `--config-setting` data now gets passed to all build-backend hooks involved,
    # even `get_requires_for_build_wheel()`. This results in the build failing, as it executes setuptools's `egg_info` command,
    # which doesn't accept the `--plat-name` argument or any other `bdist_wheel` command options.
    #
    # As a consequence of this, we need to override the build-backend and the `get_requires_for_build_wheel()` hook, so that
    # we can filter out arguments which are not relevant to the `egg_info` command.
